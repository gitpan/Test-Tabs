NAME
    Test::Tabs - check the presence of tabs in your project

SYNOPSIS
            use Test::Tabs tests => 1;
            tabs_ok('lib/Module.pm', 'Module is indented sanely');

    Or

            use Test::Tabs;
            all_perl_files_ok();

    Or

            use Test::Tabs;
            all_perl_files_ok( @mydirs );

DESCRIPTION
    This module scans your project/distribution for any perl files (scripts,
    modules, etc) for the presence of tabs.

    In particular, it checks that all indentation is done using tabs, not
    spaces; alignment is done via spaces, not tabs; indentation levels never
    jump up (e.g. going from 1 tab indent to 3 tab indent without an
    intervening 2 tab indent); and there is no trailing whitespace on any
    line (though lines may consist entirely of whitespace).

    Comment lines and pod are ignored. (A future version may also ignore
    heredocs.)

  Functions
    "all_perl_files_ok( @directories )"
        Applies "tabs_ok()" to all perl files found in @directories
        recursively. If no @directories are given, the starting point is one
        level above the current running script, that should cover all the
        files of a typical CPAN distribution. A perl file is *.pl or *.pm or
        *.t or a file starting with "#!...perl".

    "tabs_ok( $file, $text )"
        Run a tab check on $file. For a module, either the path
        ("lib/My/Module.pm") or the package name ("My::Module") can be used.

        $text is the optional test name.
